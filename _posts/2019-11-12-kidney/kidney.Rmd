## Analysis table

- Researchers : University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus   
 - Published in? 8 may 2019  
 - General topic : Research about the increase of chronic kidney illness in a agricultural workers population, in a hot area.  
 - Procedure/what was examined? The study as synthezised the literature about the topic.  They found that this chronic kidney illness appears more often (in a population of agricultural workers) is the climate is hot.  In the same time, they found that the use of nephrotoxic pesticides in hot areas is more dangerous, because of the risk of workers 's dehydratation.  One more cause of the chronic kidney desease : the presence of heavy metals in the ground of some areas in the world, for example in Sri Lanka and Central America. There is still at less one cause of the chronic kidney desease : genetical coumpound in the agricultural workers.
