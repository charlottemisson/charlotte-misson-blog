## Analysis table

- Researchers : University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus   
 - Published in? 8 may 2019  
 - General topic : Research about the increase of chronic kidney illness in an agricultural workers population, in a hot areas.  
 - Procedure/what was examined? The study as synthezised the literature about the topic.  They found that this chronic kidney illness appears more often (in a population of agricultural workers) when the climate is hot.  In the same time, they found that the use of nephrotoxic pesticides in hot areas is more dangerous, because of the risk of workers 's dehydratation.  One more cause of chronic kidney desease : the presence of heavy metals in the ground of some areas in the world, for example in Sri Lanka and Central America. There is still at less one cause of the chronic kidney desease : genetical coumponent in the agricultural workers.  
 - Conclusion/discovery? Poeple think that this chronic kidney desease linked to agricultural technics is confined in the south were the climat is hoter. But it is not. Indeed, the desease would already be present in our regions.  
 - Remaining questions? No questions, but recommendations to agricultural workers such as drink more fluids (being sure that the water is free from nephrotoxic molecules) and make adequate breaks in the shade.
