## Analysis table

- Researchers : a team led by Prof. Jan-Christian Habel of the Department of Terrestrial Ecology of the Technical University of Munich and Prof. Thomas Schmitt, Director of the Senckenberg German Entomological Institute in Muencheberg in Brandenburg   
 - Published in? 20 March 2019  
 - General topic : On cause of butterflies mortality is the overuse of pesticides in modern agriculture.  
 - Procedure/what was examined? Seventeen sites were examined, to account the number of butterflies species in. The scientists have compared areas encountered by fields sprayed by pesticides, and aeras which are not or less sprayed. They recorded 24 species and 864 individuals in a whole, distributed like this : 2.7 species in polluted areas per visit and 6.6 specides in unpolluted areas per visit.  
 - Conclusion/discovery? In areas spayed by pesticides, the divertisity and amount of butterflies are lower than in natural areas.   
 - Remaining questions? No questions, but it's clear that industrialized agriculture has a negative impact on butterfly fauna. We must have a thinking about that.
