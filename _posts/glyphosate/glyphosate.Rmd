## Context
*What is glyphosate?*
This chemical molecule is a powerful herbicid. It acts at the level of shikimate pathway (synthesis of amino acids) of several microorganisms as bacteria, virus, fungi.  
The possible consequences on animal health (including humans) is a huge debate in the world. This present article, provided by Ramazzani Institute [@vincenzobranaGlobalGlyphosateStudy2019], shows the results of studiing glyphosate on exposed rats at the "safe rate".

Aim of the study : analysing effects of an exposure at the safe dose.  

### Method

- The samples were pregnants rats.  
- The stage of pregnancy is important : the study starts at day 6 of gestation. 
- The rate of glyphosate used is the "safe dose" : 1.75mg/kg/day.  

Pregnant rats were exposed to glyphosate by drinking water. Rats consommed the water from day 6 of gestation, to postanal day 120.  
Then, two groups were formed randomly :  
- Group 1 : the rats were sacrified after puberty.  
- Group 2 : the rats were sacrified at adulthood.
The rats tissues were then analysed.

### Conclusion

For U.S, the **safe rate** of herbicids contening glyphosate is **1.75mg/kg/day**. Apart from this average, scientists have prouved that a rate lower than the "safe rate" may have healthy consequences on a rat population. More precisealy, the problems arises for reproduction and developpement.
