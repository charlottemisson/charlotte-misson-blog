## Analysis table


 - Researchers : A team working in Ramazzini Institute  
 - Published in? : 12 march 2019  
 - General topic : A study based on glyphosate which is administrated in rats at the human safe dose.  
 - Procedure/what was examined? : The samples were pregnants rats.   
The stage of pregnancy is important : the exposition starts at day 6 of gestation.  
The rate of glyphosate used is the "safe dose" : 1.75mg/kg/day.  
Pregnant rats were exposed to glyphosate by drinking water. Rats consommed the water from day 6 of gestation, to postanal day 120.  
The samples came from the offspring of exposed rats. 
Then, two groups were formed randomly :  
Group 1 : the rats were sacrified after puberty.  
Group 2 : the rats were sacrified at adulthood.
The rats tissues were then analysed.  


 - Conclusion/discovery? : For U.S, the **safe rate** of herbicids contening glyphosate is **1.75mg/kg/day**. Apart from this average, scientists have prouved that this dose of glyphosate may have healthy consequences on a rat population. More precisealy, the problems arises for reproduction and developpement of pupies (endocrine effetcs).  
 - Remaining questions : Certainly but not specified in the article.
